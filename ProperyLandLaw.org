* Module 1

** Property

Property isn't just objects but rather relates to:

- Rights of ownership
- Possesion over material objects

  
E.G if you rent a property you are in possession of it but the landlord retains ownership. The owner is free to use it, not use it, trash it or sell it. As the legal owner he can do whatever he wants.

If someone was to rent the property from him they can only exercise enjoyment from the property as tenants. So if they caused damage they would have to compensate the landlord for the cost of repair, they also have no rights whatsoever to trash the property.

** Ownership

Ownership rights are:

1) Enjoyment
2) Destruction (subject to the rights of others)
3) Disposition


Different ways of owning property:

1) Creation (you built it bro)
2) Occupation (like squatters rights)
3) Progeny: Say a farmer breeds animals, the offspring will also be his property
4) Property gained through a gift or by purchasing
5) Succession (left behind in a will or inheritance)


All land in England is owned by the crown. Those who actually "own" the land have just purchased freehold possession of it.

** Possession

Possession can be broken into two categories.

1) Corpus Possession.
   It is the intention to own something and the physical control over it. Either direct control or indirect such as an agent. Continuous control.

2) Animus Possidendi
   Control may not be actively exerted but there is an intent to have exclusive control over property. Others would be prohibited from using it.


Possession can happen legally and illegally.
E.G: The landlord owns the freehold over the land. Another may legally be in possession of the land with permission from the owner. But if someone breaks into the house, that is trespassing and they are in illegal possession of the land. (Exception being squatters rights)

*** Relationship

Relationship between ownership and possession. Possession may be used as evidence of ownership. Like when dealing with unregistered land.

* Module 2

** Classification of Property

*** Real Property

Real property relates to freehold land, buildings and the rights over such land. If the owner was unlawfully disposed they are entitled to bring 'real action' against the person who threw them out. If a dispossession was for any other type of property then you would seek compensation for the value of the property rather than repossession.

Rule of thumb: Items that are fixed to the property will come included in any transfer of ownership. Any other item is a chattel.

Some examples of chattels include furniture, refrigerators, washing machines, curtains, beds, and carpets. Chattels are not automatically included in property sales, and the seller would be expected to remove all items under this category before the property changes ownership unless both parties have agreed otherwise.

*** Personal Property

Property not considered real is known as personal property or Chattels.

Personal property can be broken into two categories:

1) Chattels Real
   This usually refers to leasehold land

2) Chattels Personal
   Chattels personal are personal property that are movable and which are not chattels real or real property.


These two can be broken down further into two sub-categories:

- Chooses in action
  Often referred to as incorporeal chattels. (a type of property that is intangible and cannot be physically touched or seen)
  E.G: Goodwill, debt, patents, intellectual rights.

- Chooses in possession
  Often referred to as corporeal chattels. (things you can see and touch) property you can transfer ownership by physical deliveries.
  E.G: Cars, jewellery, electronics etc.

** Fixtures or Chattels

Any Chattels fixed to the land becomes part of the land, a 'fixture'.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
EXAMPLE
The owner of a mill purchased some looms for use in his mill. They were attached to stone floor by nails driven into wood beams. They could quite easily be removed. The owner then mortgaged the land and failed to keep up the payments and the mill was repossessed. The question for the court was whether the looms were fixtures forming part of the land or whether they remained chattels.

Held: The looms had become fixtures and thus formed part of the land mortgaged.
#+END_QUOTE

Annexation, a formal act whereby a state proclaims its sovereignty over territory hitherto outside its domain.

Prima Facie: A Latin term literally meaning "at first appearance" or "on the face of it". It is used in both civil and criminal law to denote that, on its face, sufficient evidence exists to support a case.

Only the owner (or those lawfully appointed to exercise the rights of an owner) may remove fixtures from land. If a tenant fixes a chattel to the land then only the owner can remove it.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
EXAMPLE
A tenant in a Ground floor flat with the consent of the landlord purchased some electrical wiring, roofing equipment, wall panels and flooring. He installed them into the conservatory. By doing this they now become property of the landlord as they form part of the flat. When the tenancy came to an end the tenant removed the wiring which involved damaging the wall panels. He was convicted of criminal damage and appealed as he believed he had the right to damage the panels since he paid for them.

Held: His conviction was quashed. He lacked the mens rea of criminal damage as he believed the property he damaged belonged to him. It was irrelevant that the mistake was one of law rather than fact as it related to a mistake of civil law rather than criminal law.
#+END_QUOTE

Chattels found under the surface of the land belong to the landowner. Unless they are items classified as "treasure"

* Module 3

** Land and Estates

*** Land

Definition of land: "Land" includes land of any tenure, mines and minerals, whether or not held apart from the surface, buildings or parts of buildings (whether the division is horizontal, vertical or made in any other way) and other hereditaments; also a manor, advowson, and a rent and other incorporeal hereditaments, and an easement, ... (google this paragraph to find full definition)

- Tenure
  This means the basis upon which land is held (or conditions)

- Estate
  This means the length of time for which the land is held

*** Tenure

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
History Lesson

Free Tenure:
- Military
  This related to land held in return for men to fight for the king
- Spiritual
  Held by the church
- Socage
  Land held for supplying men to work farms
- Serjeanty
  Land held in return for personal services to the king or lord


Unfree Tenure: Land held by people who were lower class and who were sold along with the land.
#+END_QUOTE

** Estates

Speaking of Estates relates to legal interest in the land, referring to what rights the possessor has over the land, how long they are entitled to be there and conditions upon usage of the land.

** Freehold

Freehold relates to the tenure of the property and the legal estate is the fee simple absolute in possession. It can be broken down like

- Fee
  Denotes that the estate is an estate of inheritance. It can be devised by will or inherited under laws of intestacy. (when someone dies without leaving a will)

- Simple
  Denotes that the estate is not a complicated one in that, on death, it is capable of passing to the owner's general heirs.

- Absolute
  Signifies that the estate is not subject to a condition, which will bring it to an end, but will continue forever. Thus it is distinguished from a conditional fee, which, may come to an end on the happening of an event.

- In possession
  Signifies that the grantee must be entitled to immediate possession of the estate. (could be physical possession but in law means being in receipt or being entitled to the rents or profits of the property)


Thus the person holding the fee simple estate will in effect have absolute ownership lasting indefinitely and this ownership can be left to heirs.

Transfer of a freehold from one person to another must be achieved by a deed of conveyance for unregistered or deed of transfer for registered land.

** Leasehold

Leasehold: A leasehold estate is a term of years absolute. Thus meaning the freeholder grants the estate to an individual for a specific period of time. Leases must have a specified length of time. Leases must also grant exclusive possession to the leaseholder.

So in any given lease you will be find these parties:

1) Lessor
   Person granting the lease (also known as landlord)
2) Lessee
   Person who the lease is granted (leaseholder or tenant)


Lessor grants a term of years absolute of possession to the leaseholder. When these years are up the lands reverts back to the lessor. During the lease the lessee will take exclusive possession of the land in return for whatever is requested by the Lessor. (Moolah) If the Lessee breaches the terms of lease, the lessor will be entitled to dispossess the lessee prior to the lease arriving at its conclusion date.

Leasehold estate should be created by way of a deed. Although if a lease that has a term not exceeding 3 years then it doesn't needed to be created by deed. These shorted agreements (tenancies) can be created in less formal documents or even orally.

** Equitable Estates in land

1) Estate in Fee Tail
   This type of estate only descends to a particular class of heirs. E.G all males.

2) Estate for life
   This type of estate remains for the duration of a tenant's life or a third party's life.


Leasehold estate usually arises when a contract to grant a lease is entered into but a formal lease (by way of deed) is not completed.

** Creation of Legal and Equitable Estates

Grants of land by deed may take many forms. Some of these will give a legal estate while others will give an equitable estate. The type given can be established from the title or interest granted to the transferee.

Legal estates:
Must be created by way of deed, can be done in any of the following ways

1) To 'A'
   
2) To 'A' in fee simple (if no date for creation is stated then it is deemed to take immediate effect
   
3) To 'A' and His Heirs (same as 2)


Equitable Estates

1) To A In Tail (this would create a 'Fee Tail' however the tenant has full rights of possession and enjoyment and these would pass on to his heirs upon his death. But heirs could be restricted to a tail male or tail female (descending through males or females only)
   
2) To A for Life (this estate would be granted to 'A' for his life and upon his death the estate terminates. This is called a 'Life Estate'

3) To A as long as B shall survive (the estate continues during the life of another)

   



* Module 4

** Registered land

*** Registered title

All titles must be stored electronically

Proof of ownership is now verified through the register itself rather than the examination of deeds.

Solicitors are provided with copies of the register and must update the register within two month if:

1) A transfer of the freehold (for consideration of by way of gift)

2) A grant of a lease (of more than seven years)

3) An assignment of a lease which at a time of being assigned has more than 7 years remaining

4) The granting of a first legal mortgage

   This is done via the solicitors submitting all title deeds and documents to HMRC who will confirm that stamp duty has been paid. An application will also be submitted for registration, the land registry then investigate the title as it should be and subsequently carry out the registration.

   The land register itself now represents a state backed guarantee that all deeds are correct and represents an official database of the owners of land and the various rights held in land.

*** Priority in Registered Land

The underlying principal of a system of land registration is that a person seeking to require an interest in land need only check the register to determine if the land is subject to any adverse interests. A person who is interested needs to take action to protect that interest by entering it on the register. Generally a purchaser will take free of any interests not on register, however this is not absolute. Depends on the type of interests involved.

A basic rule is that priority between interests in registered land is given by order of creation. Earlier interests will be given priority over the later (on the face of things). First come first serve kind of thing.

*BASIC RULE*

1) The priority of an interest affecting a registered estate or charge is not affected by a disposition of the estate or charge.

2) It makes no difference for the purposes of this section whether the interest or disposition is registered.


In the case of a registered estate the following are the dispositions which are required to be completed by registration.

a) a transfer
b) where the registered estate is an estate in land, the grant of a term of years absolute. (a term of more than 7 years from the date of grant)
c) where the registered estate is a franchise or manor, the grant of a lease
d) the grant of a legal charge

*Equitable Interests behind a trust*

In many instances the question of priority will not arise in relation to equitable interests behind a trust since overreaching will operate to transfer the interests to the proceeds of sale. It is only where the capital moneys are paid to a single trustee that the issue of priority will arise. Where this is the case the beneficial interest may rank as an overriding interest if the occupational requirements are satisfied.

*** Overriding interests in Registered Land.

Overriding interests include leases under 7 years, legal easements and profits a prendre (a right to take something from another person's land), public rights of way, local land charges, mines and minerals, franchises, manorial rights, a right to rent reserved to the crown, non statutory rights in respect of an embankment or sea or river wall, right to payment in lieu of a tithe, a right in respect to the repair of a church. Any interest belonging to a person in actual occupation.

An interest may become overriding in two situations

1) Where the person claiming interest is in actual occupation and that occupation would be obvious on a reasonable inspection or

2) Where the person claiming the interest is in actual occupation and the person to whom the disposition made has actual knowledge of the interest.
   
* Module 5

** Unregistered land and Doctrine of notice

New dispositions of land must be registered. But there what if there is unregistered land.
 
When we say registered or unregistered we are referring to registered or unregistered title. Title refers to proof of ownership.

*** Unregistered Title

Where land is unregistered, proof of ownership will be evidenced by a collection of deeds and documents that will be collectively referred to as the title deeds.

Each time a transfer of ownership takes place additional documents are added to the bundle. Over time this can make the deeds to unregistered land quite large and complex.

*** The Doctrine of Notice - Unregistered Land

Doctrine of notice applied in unregistered land to determine priority of equitable interests not governed by the Land Charges Act 1925

Under the Doctrine of a bona fide purchaser of a legal estate for value takes over any pre-existing equitable interest which is not registrable as a land charge, provided they did not have actual constructive or imputed notice of their existence.

The Doctrine of Notice has no application in registered land where priority is determined by a separate regime including overriding and minor interests. The Doctrine of Notice is therefore relevant in unregistered land where the capital moneys of the conveyance were paid to a single trustee. For a purchaser or mortgagee to acquire the land free of the pre-existing equitable interest they must prove that they are a bona fide purchaser of a legal estate for value without notice.

*Bona Fides*
Is a latin term meaning good faith. The purchaser or mortgagee must demonstrate they acted in good faith in entering the transaction.

*Legal Estate*
This includes a purchase of the freehold, a legal lease or charge by way of legal mortgage

*For Value*
This excludes gifts and conveyances for a nominal consideration. The consideration need not be market value.

*Without Notice*
For the purchaser or mortgagee to take the legal estate free from the equitable interest, they must not have notice (knowledge) of the interest. Where a purchaser or mortgagee is aware or should have been aware of the equitable interest this affects their conscience and they are then bound by the interest.

*Actual Notice*
This is where the purchaser or mortgagee was consciously aware of the existence of the equitable interest.

*Constructive Notice*
Constructive notice is concerned with what the purchaser or mortgagee ought to be aware of or what they would have discovered by making reasonable inquiries.

** Land Charges

Some interests in unregistered land are able to be protected by registration. Called a land charge. Here are the following classes:

*** Classes of Land Charges

- Class A Land charge

  A right to receive money that requires the person entitled to apply for it under an Act of Parliament.

- Class B Land charge

  A right to receive money automatically under an Act of Parliament without needing to apply.

- Class C Land charge (1)

  A puisine mortgage (basically a second mortgage) its not protected by the deposit of legal documents.

- Class C Land charge (2)

  A limited owners charge: an equitable charge for tenants for life or owners who pay Inheritance Tax or other liabilities. Priority given by law.

- Class C Land charge (3)

  A general equitable charge: equitable charge that's not secured by legal documents, not linked to a trust and not covered by other land charge categories.

- Class C Land charge (4)

  Estate contracts: includes a contract to transfer property, options to purchase or rights of pre-emption.

- Class D (1) Land charge

  Inland Revenue Charge

- Class D (2) Land charge

  Restrictive covenants. Only those entered on or after 1st Jan 1926. Restrictive covenants entered before this date are governed by the doctrine of notice.

- Class D (3) Land charge

  Equitable easements. (only those entered on or after 1st Jan 1926

- Class E Land charge

  Annuities created prior to Jan 1st 1926 and not registered to the register of annuities.

- Class F Land charge

  Right of occupation under Part 4 Family Law Act 1996 (protects spouses or other family members, property can't be sold without their knowledge or consent)


*** Registration of Land Charges

A land charge shall be registered in the name of the estate owner whose estate is intended to be affected.

The name should be the same as that found in the conveyance by which the estate had been conveyed.

Where a land charge has been registered in the correct name, this serves as actual notice of its existence. (however if a someone enters a contract to buy the land and a search of the register later reveals a land charge he didn't know about he is not obliged to complete the contract)

Where a land charge is registered in an incorrect name, a subsequent interest may take priority.

** Searches

Searches of land charges register may be personal or official. An official search offers greater protection.

An official search certificate is conclusive even if a mistake was made by the Land Registry. This means a purchaser can rely on the certificate and take priority over any land charges not disclosed on the certificate.

** Unregistered Land Charges

Where a land charge is not registered, the land charge will be void under certain circumstances, (statutory conditions) these statutory conditions are different depending on the class of land charge.

- Class A
  
  A land charge is void against a purchaser of the land or of any interest in the land unless the charge is registered in the appropriate register before the completions of the purchase.

- Class B, C(1), C(2), C(3)

  A land charge of Class B or Class C other than an estate contract is void against a purchaser of the land or of any interest in the land unless the charge is registered in the appropriate register before the completion of the purchase.

- Class C(4) and Class D

  An estate contract and a land charge of Class D created or entered into on or after 1st January 1926 shall be void as against a purchaser or money or money's worth of legal estate in the land charged with it, unless the land charge is registered in the appropriate register.

- Class F

  A land charge of Class F is void against a purchaser of the land or of any interest in the land unless the charge is registered in the appropriate register before the completions of the purchase.

- Exception

  A void land charge may be held to be binding in instances estoppel. (can't go back on their word)
  A person may be estopped from denying the existence of the land charge as held.

* Module 6

** Land Trusts

*** Express Trust

An express trust is where the legal owners of the property declare that they hold the property on trust for specified beneficiaries.

Requirements to create an express trust.

1) An intention to create a trust

   The legal owner must make it clear that they intend to hold the land for the benefit of another. (not as a gift)

2) Declaration must be evidenced in writing

   Requires the declaration of trust to be evidenced in writing and signed by the person declaring the trust. The written declaration must contain the material terms of the trust.

3) Transfer of legal title to the trustee

   Only applies when the legal owner intends to create an express trust by transferring the legal title to a third party.

4) The trust must not offend the rule of perpetuity


*** Resulting Trust

Arises in the abscence of an express declaration where a person holds a legal title in circumstances where they cannot be taken to have full equitable ownership.


**** Automatic Resulting Trust

 An automatic resulting trust will arise where the settlor (trust creator) transfers property to the intended trustee but the trust has failed for some reason. The trustee holds the legal title of the property on trust. The beneficial or equitable ownership is retained by the settlor.

**** Presumed Resulting Trust

Presumed resulting trusts arise either from voluntary transfer of the legal estate or by contribution to the purchase price. In these situations it is presumed that the person did not intent to make a gift to the property or money unless there is a clear intention that they did so intend. In such circumstances a resulting trust arises and the transferor or the person making the contribution retains or takes a share in the beneficial interest. However in some relationships there is a counter presumption that a gift was intended. This is known as the presumption of advancement.

If there exists evidence that a gift was intended, this will rebut the presumption of resulting trust and the transferee will be absolutely entitled to the property and the transferor will not be entitled to any share in the beneficial ownership.


*** Constructive Trust

Constructive trusts are trusts that may be implied in the absence of a declaration of trust, where the trustee has induced another to act to their detriment in the belief that they do so act to their detriment they would acquire a beneficial interest in the land. There is an overlap with resulting and constructive trusts since both generally involve a contribution to the purchase price, however, the two types of trusts are distinct. Whilst under resulting trusts the beneficial entitlement is calculated mathematically in proportion to the contribution to the purchase price, the shares of constructive trusts are determined by a number of factors that may result in the share being much greater than the amount contributed. There is also an overlap with constructive trusts and proprietary estoppel since both require  detriment and work on the basis that it would be unconscionable for the legal owner to deny the existence of the beneficial interest.

(Imagine you and a friend decide to buy a big toy together. But instead of buying it the normal way, your friend says, "Hey, if you help me with this, I promise you'll get part of the toy, but you don’t have to write anything down."

Now, you help out, but your friend doesn't keep their promise and tries to say the toy is only theirs. This wouldn’t feel right, right? You helped, and you were told you'd get some of the toy! This is where a constructive trust comes in. Even though there was no official paper or promise, the law says your friend must share the toy with you because you helped.

But there's a difference between a constructive trust and a resulting trust. In a resulting trust, if you helped pay for the toy, you would get a share of the toy based exactly on how much you paid. For example, if you paid half, you get half of the toy.

A constructive trust, on the other hand, can give you more than just a share based on how much you paid. It might take into account other things, like promises or the way you were treated, so you might get more than what you paid for, if that seems fair.

Finally, proprietary estoppel is similar. It happens when someone promises you something (like part of the toy) and you believe that promise, so you act on it, but then they try to take it back. It's unfair for them to do that, so the law says they can't go back on their word, and you should get the share you were promised.

So, in summary, all these ideas are about making sure people are treated fairly when promises are made, especially if someone helps out but doesn’t get what they expected.) - asked chatgpt to explain to a 7 year old.

1) Inducement

   It must be shown that the legal owner of the land induced the claimant to believe they would be entitled to a share in the ownership. There are two ways of demonstrating this:

   - Express agreement

   - Contribution to the acquisition

2) Claimant must act to their detriment (i.e by contribution to purchase price)


* Module 7

** Special Interests

There are three categories of land interest that we refer to as special. These are:

*** Easements

Easements refer to a right to use or restrict the use of another person's land in a particular way. A common example of an easement is a right of way.

There must be a dominant and a servient tenement. The land on which the easement need exist is called the dominant tenement and the land which relies upon easement is known as the servient. (serving)

It must be possible to include the easement in the subject matter of a grant by deed. There needs to be a capable grantor and a capable grantee. The grant must be of something that can be realistically defined and bare the resemblance of an easement. The tenements must be owned separately. Meaning the dominant and the serviant cannot be owned by the same person.

*** Profits a Prendre

This relates to the right to take something from the land of another. (E.G the right to fish from a stream etc.)

The key differences between an easement and a Profit are:

| Easement                                        | Profit                                                       |
| Must relate to land that is annexed in some way | Can exist regardless of the proximity of various land owners |
|                                                 | May be a several profit enjoyed exclusively by one person.   |
|                                                 | May be a profit enjoyed by several people                    |

Easements and Profits can be created via statute, prescription or grant:


| Grant                                             | Prescription                                                          |
| Most commonly used                                | Created purely by length of time it has been in existence             |
| Owner the serviant tenement creates the servitude | Right has existed over a long period of time, it is recognised as law |
| It need not be in writing.                        |                                                                       |


*** Restrictive Covenants

A restrictive covenant is an agreement involving restricting the use of freehold land. These agreements are not only binding on the on the originally contracted owners of the land.

May be enforced subject to the following conditions:

1) The covenant must be negative in nature (E.G one that prohibits something being done

2) The covenant must "touch and concern" the land

3) The land in respect of which the covenant is claimed must be owned by the person who seeks to enforce it.

4) Where the claimant of the benefit of the covenant is not the original covenantee (E.g the person in whose favour the covenant was granted) he must show that the benefit of the covenant has been expressly assigned to him or that it was originally annexed to the land, or relates to land subject to a building scheme or a scheme of development.


**  Rights above and below the surface of Land

We used to think that the owner of the land owned everything up to the heavens and down to the depth of the Earth. This is no longer strictly the case.

Landowners own the airspace above his land and may bring an action for trespass against an intruder or where another places an object which projects into their airspace. A sign etc
This right is restricted to such a height as is reasonably necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of his land and the structure upon it.

Manmade and natural spaces below land are capable of ownership. The space belongs to the owner of the surface of the land even if it was created by another and the landowner has no access.

The owner is generally entitled to the minerals within the land. But this is subject to the rights of the Crown in relation to oil, coal, natural gas, gold and silver.

Items found below the surface of the land belong to the landowner. (Unless they are items of treasure trove)


*  Module 8

**  Conveyancing

Conveyancing is the legal process involved when property changes ownership.

1) All conveyances of land or of any interest therin are void for the purpose of conveying or creating a legal estate unless made by deed.

2) This section does not apply to-
   a) assents by a personal representative;
   b) surrenders by operation of law, including surrenders which may, by law, be effected without writing
   c) leases or tenancies or other assurances not requires by law to be made in writing;
   d) receipts other than those falling within section 115 below
   e) vesting orders of the court or other competent authority
   f) conveyances taking effect by operation of law


Section 53 goes on to state that the disposition and creation of interests in land must be made in writing.

1) Subject to the provision hereinafter contained with respect to the creation of interests in land by parol

   a) no interest in land can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the person creating or conveying the same, or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorised in writing, or by will, or by operation of law;

   b) a declaration of trust respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person who is able to declare such trust or by his will;

   c) a disposition of an equitable interest or trust subsiding at the time of the disposition, must be in writing signed by the person disposing of the same, or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorised in writing or by will.

   
*** Procedure

When a buyer has decided on a property they want to buy, he then maker an offer. This offer is usually done through the seller's estate agents. These types of offers are said to be made 'subject to contract', therefore even if the offer is accepted (unlike under the usual laws of contract) there will be no binding agreement until a formal contract is drawn up by the seller's conveyancers, agreed with the buyer, signed by both parties and exchanged.

Once a seller accepts an offer then the conveyancing process begins. This process can be seperated into three sections.

**** Pre-Contract

This is the stage between the buyer making an offer and the contracts being exchanged. This stage is usually where both parties make their definitive decision to commit to the transaction. The buyer will make all relevant enquiries through their solicitor that there is nothing wrong with the property and that he is satisfied with the terms of sale. The buyer will also make the final arrangements to secure any money he may be borrowing to facilitate the purchase.

Once the buyer is satisfied, the parties will exchange contracts, the buyer signs the drafted contract and sends to the seller's solicitor along with the necessary deposit. In return the contract is signed and sent to the buyer.

It is essential to instruct a solicitor to act for you as either the seller or th ebuyer in a conveyancing transaction.

The seller's solicitor must prepare the pre-contract package for the buyer, which includes the draft contract, evidence of the seller's legal title to the property and sometimes the results of pre-contract searches and other information relating to the property.

The buyer's solicitor must check the documents supplied by the seller and raise any queries by means or questions or requests (known as 'requisitions'), often asking the seller to resolve any problems.

The buyer's solicitor needs to carry out relevant pre-contract searches. Many of these will be with public bodies like the local authority and will enable the buyer to obtain information about the property.

The buyer needs to confirm that he is able to proceed with the transaction in financial terms (usually this involves securing an offer of finance).

When relevant checks have been completed and amendments to the contract negotiated, the buyer's solicitor can return the draft contract to the seller. Two copies of the contract are then printed; the seller signs one and the buyer signs the other.

'Exchange of contracts' signifies the point at which a binding contract has been entered into. On exchange, the buyer will usually pay a deposit.

**** Contract to Completion

Both parties will then make final checks to ensure everything is still as it should be. Such as the buyer making sure nothing has changed with the property and that the required finance has been recieved. At this stage the deed is prepared and executed.

The property has officially been sold when the deed is executed in exchange for the purchase price.

**** Post contract stage

The buyer raises further requisitions with the seller, usually to resolve procedural enquiries;

At the same time, the buyer solicitor sends the draft purchase deed to the seller's solicitor. This activates the terms of the contract. Once the seller's solicitor has approved the deed it can be 'engrossed' (a copy is prepared and then signed, usually by both parties).

The buyer's solicitor needs to obtain the mortgage loan from the buyer's lender and the money that the buyer has to make up the balance due on completion.

The seller's solicitor must confirm with the seller's lender the exact amount of money required to discharge his mortgage (if he has one on the property).

Completion can be done in person or by post, whereby the money is transmitted to seller's solicitor and the deeds are sent to the buyer's solicitor. 

**** Post completion

This is pretty much the clerical stage, where the transfer is registered, land tax and stamp duties are paid.

It is necessary to note that although we refer to buyers and sellers as just that. The land registry uses alternate phrases. The seller, the person who is transferring their property to someone else is referred to as the transferor and the buyer, who is having property transferred to them is known as the transferee.

The seller's solicitor discharging the seller's mortgage and sending a receipt to the buyer's solicitor.

The buyer's solicitor must pay any stamp duty land tax due on the property.

The buyer's solicitor must apply to the Land Registry for the title to be registered.

** Mortgages

Two parties involved in a mortgage are labelled

Mortgagor - This is the name given to the person borrowing money and granting the mortgage. A mortgage is the name given to the deed that has to be executed and creates the basis of the property become security for the loan. So in a typical house purchase, the bank grants a loan and the buyer grants a mortgage to the bank.

Mortgagee - This is the party lending the money, typically a bank or building society. They lend money to the buyer in return for a mortgage to use the house as security for the debt.

The word mortgage derives from French. Mort meaning deed and Gage meaning pledge. In simple terms, the Mortgagee (Lender) grants to the Mortgagor (borrower) a loan. The borrower then grants to the Lender a Mortgage (i.e a legal interest in the land secured by way of a Mortgage Deed) to secure the payment of a loan.

If the mortgagor repays the loan, then the mortgage is cancelled and the mortgagor assumes full control of the land. If the loan is not repaid, then the mortgagee can take possession of the land in settlement of the debt.

It should be remembered that the mortgages can be executed over freeholds or leasehold, whether the title is registered or unregistered, and the mortgage created can be either legal or equitable.

*** Legal and Equitable Mortgages

**** Legal Mortgage

For freeholds land - Granting of a lease for a term of years subject to the promise that the lease will terminate upon repayment of the debt.

A charge by deed expressed to by way of a legal mortgage (legal charge). This method is more popular as it is simpler.

In both instances the legal estate becomes the property of the mortgagor, however the mortgagee (bank) will have created a legal interest in the land until the mortgage is paid off.

Legal mortgages can now only be created by legal charge as of 2002. However due to the length of mortgages, as you can imagine, there are still a substantial amount of mortgages in existence that were created prior to 2002.

**** Equitable Mortgage

These are created by:

The mortgagor depositing the title deeds (unregistered land) or title information (registered land) with the mortgagee with the intent that they will be security for the loan

By depositing the title deeds (unregistered land) or title information document (registered land) and putting the intent beyond doubt by the Mortgagor(s) completing a memorandum which evidences that the title documents have been deposited and security. Note: The memorandum is usually signed under hand. But, if executed under seal, it will contain special clauses, which give the Mortgagee the equivalent rights of a legal Mortgagee.

** Types of Mortgages.

*** Repayment Mortgages

The money is borrowed over a specified period of time (usually 25 years) the capital loan and interest owed over 25 years are calculated and divided into equal monthly payments. The payments may change slightly depending on whether the individual has a fixed rate mortgage or a variable mortgage.

*** Endowment Mortgage

With this type of mortgage an endowment policy is taken out at the same time as the mortgage with Insurance Company. An endowment policy is one whereby the Insurance Company will pay out a lump sum at a fixed future date on the basis of your paying to them a monthly premium. The idea is that the Insurance Company will invest the premiums and therefore you will get back more than you pay in. This is not such a popular type of mortgage than it used to be, as investment yields have not done very well over the years.

** Remedies of a Legal Mortgage

- Sue for the debt on the mortgagor's personal covenant to repay

This remedy is available also to unsecured creditors and is used when the mortgagor is unwilling rather than unable to settle a debt. It saves realising the security, but is a process rarely taken because the mortgagor's unwillingness to pay is invariably due to him having insufficient funds. Today, some mortgage forms omit the availability of this remedy - but it is available as a right anyway.

- Appoint a Receiver

This occurs primarily with properties that are rented out to tenants. The receiver collects rent from the property and applies them to debt in the following order:

1) In payment of outstanding amounts to any prior mortgagee;

2) In payment of rates, taxes and other outgoings;

3) In payment of his own commission;

4) In payment of insurance;

5) In reduction of the principal amount die, when directed by the mortgagee.


The receiver is deemed to be an agent of the mortgagor and, therefore, the mortgage is not liable for any of his actions, nor is he liable for the costs of Receivership.

- Foreclose

A foreclose order will deprive the mortgagor of his equity of redemption. Meaning this deprives the mortgagor redeeming full legal interest in the property at the end of the mortgage. The property will be vested forever in the name of the mortgagee. These orders are granted by the court, however they are very rare. Foreclosures do not achieve much for either party, as the mortgagor upon bringing a legal action simply wants to be repaid. Therefore a sale would make more sense.

- Enter into possession

This remedy is rarely pursued because the same effect is achieved more economically and without onerous responsibilities by appointing a Receiver. However, in theory, this right is available. When it is used, the mortgagee becomes accountable, not only for the profits which he received, but also for those which might have been received has he, as mortgagee not been negligent.

- Sell the property

  Most commonly exercised legal remedy, whereby the mortgagee exercises their power to sell the property. The mortgagee has the right to do so when the mortgagor has defaulted on payments for three months of a total of at least two months interest has become due.


* Module 9

** Overreaching

Overreaching is where certain equitable interests in land cease upon the sale of land.

It is a mechanism aimed at achieving conveyancing efficiency with minimal regard to protecting interests held in land. It applies where there exists a trust of land in both registered and unregistered land. Overreaching is the process by which the rights of beneficiaries under a trust of land, become detached from land on conveyance and attach to the proceeds of sale. Thus a person holding only beneficial ownership can be said to have rights in the value of the land rather than the land itself.

Difficulties arise where the beneficial owner does not hold legal title as the trustees may convey the property without their knowledge or consent. Overreaching ensures the purchaser of land takes the property free from any beneficial interests and applies irrespective of notice.

Exceptions:

1) Any equitable interest protected by a deposit of documents relating to the legal estate affected;

2) The benefit of any covenant or agreement restrictive of the user of land;

3) Any easement, liberty, or privilege over or affecting any land and being merely and equitable interest.

4) The benefit of any contract to convey or create a legal estate, including a contract conferring either expressly or by statutory implication a valid option to purchase, a right of pre-emption, or any other like right;

5) Any equitable interest protected by registration under the Land Charges Act, 1925, other than

   a) An annuity within the meaning of Part 2. Of that Act;
   b) A limited owner's charge or a general equitable charge within the mearning of that Act.


*Overreaching applies where there is a conveyance to a purchaser of a legal estate*

The definition of purchaser applicable to overreaching is where "a person who aquires an interest in or charge on property for money or money's worth as per Section 205(1) Law of Property Act 1925

Overreaching will operate even where a mortgage discharged existing indebtedness so that no money was advanced.

In order for overreaching to operate, the purchaser must pay any capital money arising under the conveyance to at least two trustees or a trust corporation.


* Module 10

Those who do not own land but legally obtain the right to enjoy usage of land by way of lease.

** Leases and Licenses

A lease is a form of ownership of land, however, unlike freehold ownership which lasts forever, leasehold ownership lasts for a specified period of time. A lease may take the form of a legal estate or it may be an equitable interest depending on the formality used to create it. It is important to distinguish a lease from a licence.

If a person occupies under a lease they have more protection than one who occupies under a licence. Leases created prior to January 1989 are protected by the Rent Act 1977 which provided tenants some protection from eviction and also provides that tenants are only obliged to pay a fair rent which may be less than market value.

Tenancies created after January 1989 have less protection under the housing act 1988. Licensees, however have limited protection, in many instances they may be evicted at will or in the event of a contractual license the term of notice provided in the contract. Licensees have no interest (legal or equitable) in land.

Personal Privilege given to a person (license) or interest in land (tenancy)

A lease may be created even if the landlord does not have an estate which enables him to grant a lease. A lease will only be created where all the requirements of a lease are present.

Three requirements for a valid lease were held to be:

1) The grant of exclusive possession
2) For a period of time which is certian
3) The payment of rent


* Module 11

** Requirements of a Lease

1) the grant of exclusive possession
2) for a period of time which is certian
3) the payment of rent

*** Exclusive possession

Exclusive possession is the most contentious and complex requirement for a lease. Exclusive possession looks to legal entitlement rather than what is actually going on in practice. In this sense it needs to be distinguished from exclusive occupation which does relate to what is happening in practice.

If a person does not have exclusive occupation then they do not have exclusive possession and therefore they do not have a lease.

A lodger is a licencee as opposed to a tenant. A lodger is one who shares occupation of the premises with the owner. A lodger does not have the right to exclude the owner from the premises. The owner may provide services to the lodger such as meals and cleaning services.

Long term hotel residents are licensees.

*Service Occupancy*

Where the occupation arises through employment this is likely to create a licence as opposed to a tenancy. To determine if an occupation is one of service, the test applied is whether the servant is required to occupy premises in order to better perform his duties as a servant.

*Social and Domestic agreements*

In social and domestic agreements between friends and family it is presumed that there is no intention to create legal regulations and therefore a licence is created rather than a lease.

** Certain period of time

To create a lease the grant must be for a certain period of time. This means there must be an identifiable start date and there must be certainty as to the duration of the lease.


* Module 12

** Adverse Possession

This is the process whereby an individual commonly referred to as a squatter, takes possession of land and later attempts to establish rights over that land. (Usually 12 years)

*** Claiming adverse possession

In order to make a successful claim on either registered or unregistered land the squatter must demonstrate that they were in factual possession for the requisite period of time and that they had the intention to possess. [Powell v McFarlane]

** Factual Possession

What counts as Factual Possession will differ depending on the nature of the land. The possession must be exclusive and it must be adverse [Lord Advocate v Lord Lovat] [Red House Farms v Catchpole]

Fencing the land off will generally be indicative of factual possession. [Buckingham CC v Moran]

1) True owner must either a) have been dispossessed, or b) have discontinued his possession, of the land; and

2) The squatter must have been in adverse possession of it for the statutory period before action brought.


*Possession must be adverse*

The squatter must be in factual possession as a trespasser. If they have permission to be on the land, the possession is not adverse. However if a person exceeds their permission this may be classed as adverse.

*The possession must be open and not deliberately concealed*

It should be clear upon reasonable inspection of the land that the other party adversely possesses the land.

** Intention to Possess

Once the squatter has established they were in factual possession, they must also demonstrate that they had the intention to possess.

A person with a mistaken belief in permission can have the necessary intent to possess.

*Dispossession of the squatter by the paper owner*

The paper owner of the land may dispossess the squatter before the expiry date of the limitation period to defeat their claim. Concurrent possession with the squatter will prevent adverse possession starting but it is insufficient to dispossess. In addition oral demands for possession are insufficient.

A written demand is also insufficient [Mount Carmel Investments v Peter Thurlow]

Acknowledgement of payment by the squatter will break the continuity of the adverse possession.

** Acquiring Title

Where the land is unregistered, the squatter acquires good title to the land after being in adverse possession for 12 years.

If the land is registered the squatter must make an application to the registrar after 10 years of adverse possession. The registrar is then obliged to notify to the registered proprietor of any registered charge on the estate. This is to alert them to the intended claim on the estate and give them the opportunity to object to the registration.

If no objection is lodged, the applicant squatter will be registered as the proprietor within 65 days of the notice being issued. This applies even if the notice did not reach the registered proprietor.

A valid objection will defeat the squatter's application to be registered at this point. The interested party must take steps to evict the squatter. If they fail to do so, the squatter can make a further application after two further years of being in adverse possession.


* Module 13

** Proprietary Estoppel

Proprietary Estoppel is a process whereby a person's equitable interest is recognized by the courts as it would be unconscionable to disregard it.

The doctrine of proprietary estoppel can be used to create freehold ownership, a lease, a license or an easement. It requires the claimant to establish an equitable interest.

5 legal rights to fight proprietary estoppel

1) plaintiff must make a mistake as to his legal rights

2) plaintiff must have expended some money or must have done some act on the faith of his mistaken belief

3) the defendant must know of the existence of his own right which is inconsistent with the right claimed by the plaintiff

4) the defendant must know of the plaintiff's mistaken belief of his rights

5) the defendant must have encouraged the plaintiff in his expenditure of money or in the other acts which he has done, either directly or by abstaining from asserting his legal right. (the defendant must have encouraged the claimant in his act of reliance)

Under the modern approach there are three requirements to establish an equity for proprietary estoppel:

1) An assurance giving rise to an expectation that the claimant would have an interest in land

2) The claimant must demonstrate reliance on the assurance

3) The claimant must have acted to their detriment as a result of the assurance.

** An Assurance

An assurance may be active or passive. An active assurance can be by words or conduct of the owner that leads the claimant to believe that they will have an interest in the house.

A passive assurance is where the claimant is mistaken in his expectation that they would gain an interest in the land and the owner stands by and does nothing to change their belief. 

If these requirements are not recognised, proprietary estoppel will lose contact with its roots and risk becoming unprincipled and therefore unpredictable if it has not already become so. 

The assurance must relate to an interest in the property.

** Reliance on the Assurance

The claimant must show that they had relied on the assurance. This is generally shown through changing their conduct.

In most instances, it is relatively easy to establish reliance and the courts have come close to adopting a presumption of reliance where there exists a representation. 

** Detriment or change of position 

The claimant must act to their detriment or significantly change their position. 

** Satisfying the Equity

Once an equity has been established by the claimant, the court must assess the appropriate remedy to award. This is a matter of deciding which interest in land to award or whether to award monetary compensation. in doing so, the courts have a wide discretion to do. what is just an equitable to satisfy the equity. the courts will have regard to the expectation of the claimant but the interest they expected is not always the one awarded the courts will consider the proportionality between the expectation and the detriment.

* Simplified Terms

*Bona Fides*
This Latin term means "good faith." It means the buyer or lender must show they acted honestly when making the deal.

*Legal Estate*
This refers to ownership of property, which can include buying the freehold, holding a legal lease, or having a legal mortgage.

*For Value*
The transaction must involve something valuable in return, but it doesn't have to be full market value. Free gifts or very small payments don't count.

*Without Notice*
A buyer or lender isn't responsible for hidden interests in the property if they didn't know about them. If they knew or should have known about such claims, they might be bound by them.

*Actual Notice*
This means the buyer or lender was clearly aware of the claim on the property.

*Constructive Interests*
This means the buyer or lender should have known about something if they had made reasonable checks or inquiries. Its about what they ought to know, not just what they actually know.

*Beneficial Interest*
Beneficial interest is the right to enjoy or benefit from something, even if you don’t actually own it. You might not have legal ownership, but you get to use it, make decisions about it, or receive any rewards from it.
So, if you put a house in someone else's name, but you still live in it or get the rent money, you have the beneficial interest in that house — even though the other person holds the legal title.

*Equitable Interest*
An equitable interest is a legal right or claim on a property that isn't full ownership but gives someone a fair share or benefit. For example, if someone has invested in or has a promise related to the property, they may have an equitable interest in it.

*Legal Interest*
A legal interest is a right in property governed by statute and common law.

*Equitable Ownership*
Equitable ownership is when someone has the right to something, even though someone else is physically holding or controlling it. It's like the "real" ownership that exists even if you don’t have the item in your hands right now.

*Overriding Interests*
Overriding interests are property rights that bind a new owner or lender, even if they're not registered on the lands official record. These rights "override" the registration system, meaning they still apply without being noted on the title.

*Inland Revenue Charge*
Security for unpaid taxes.
E.G: John Owes 10,000 in unpaid taxes but can't pay. The tax authority places an Inland Revenue charge on his house. This means if John sells the house, the $10,000 must be paid from the sale proceeds before he receives anything. If John still doesn't pay, the tax authority might take legal action to sell the house and collect the debt.

*Equitable Easements*
An equitable easement is a legal agreement that gives the owner of one property the right to restrict the use of another property for the benefit of their own. The main difference between an equitable easement and a legal easement is that an equitable easement only binds a purchaser if they were already aware of it, making it possible to challenge.

*Interest*
Interest itself means someone's legal rights or claims over a piece of property.
